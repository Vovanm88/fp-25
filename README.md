### Задача 1

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$. The first ten terms would be:

$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \dots$$

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

$$\begin{align}
\mathbf{1} &: 1\\
\mathbf{3} &: 1, 3\\
\mathbf{6} &: 1, 2, 3, 6\\
\mathbf{10} &: 1, 2, 5, 10\\
\mathbf{15} &: 1, 3, 5, 15\\
\mathbf{21} &: 1, 3, 7, 21\\
\mathbf{28} &: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28
\end{align}$$

We can see that $28$ is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

### Задача 2

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is $23$.

```
3
7 4
2 4 6
8 5 9 3
```

That is, $3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23$.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:

```
75
95 64
17 47 82
18 35 87 10
20 04 82 47 65
19 01 23 75 03 34
88 02 77 73 07 63 67
99 65 04 28 06 16 70 92
41 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 33
41 48 72 33 47 32 37 16 94 29
53 71 44 65 25 43 91 52 97 51 14
70 11 33 28 77 73 17 78 39 68 17 57
91 71 52 38 17 14 91 43 58 50 27 29 48
63 66 04 68 89 53 67 30 73 16 69 87 40 31
04 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23
```

**NOTE:** As there are only $16384$ routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, Problem 67 is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)
